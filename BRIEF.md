# GameAnalytics Frontend Coding Challenge
The purpose of this exercise is to better understand both your programming skills and the way you approach
problems and implement solutions.

We would like you to build a small single page application that implements a movie catalog. In this application
the user should be able to:
* See a list of the new movies - (released in the last 3 months)
* Search for a particular movie
* Favorite a movie and filter by favorite movies
* Sort by: vote value

You should spend no more than 3 hours on this exercise.
You should follow the design below as a guideline:

## Requirements

* The user should be able to see a list of movies posted in the API. (The movies should be sorted by the
‘vote_average’ attribute)
* The user should be able to use the search input to look for a movie by name. (Use the API to query the
movies)
* There should be a way for the user to favorite a movie from the list. (You may use the local storage for
this feature)
* The user should be able to filter by: All Movies, New Movies, Favorite Movies
* The user should be able to sort by Vote Score

##Guidelines

* The exercise should be done with no framework. It should be done using plain html, css and ES6
javascript. (To interact with the API the “fetch” api can be used)
* No usage of pre processors, like Webpack
* Document your code clearly
* Separate you HTML, CSS and Javascript code in different files
* We value code quality. Use consistent and clean styles across the codebase
* Provide clear instructions on how to build and run tests
